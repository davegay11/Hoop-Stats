# Hoop-Stats
A simple program written in MIPS assembly language

HoopStats.s is a simple program that sorts basketball players by points per minute (PPM) after the user inputs players names, points per game (PPG), and minutes per game (MPG). I originally wrote this program (with a few minor alterations) in C, and later rewrote it in MIPS.

My implementation dynamically allocates memory from the heap with each new player. It organizers the player into a linked list, then sorts and prints the player name and points per minute.
